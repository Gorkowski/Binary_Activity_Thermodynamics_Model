# Binary Activity Thermodynamics Model
Water plays an essential role in aerosol chemistry, gas-to-particle partitioning, and particle viscosity, but it is not typically included in organic aerosol thermodynamic models.  We have developed a water-sensitive organic aerosol thermodynamic model that can adapt to different levels of chemical information. Our model is capable of using both detailed molecular structures as well as bulk properties like O:C and component volatility classes. The first development stage is accounting for non-ideal interactions of organic aerosol components with water.  With the non-ideal water-organic interactions accounted for we can realistically simulate organic aerosol using ambient measurements. This capability uses our new Binary Activity Thermodynamics (BAT) modeling framework, which describes a mixture of organics with water as binary mixtures of one organic and associated water. For gas-particle partitioning, we use a non-ideal Volatility Basis Set (VBS) formulation that includes activity coefficients and accounts for liquid-liquid equilibrium.
